# CLI-Spline

A small CLI game using cubic spline interpolation (pronounced *klie-spline*). Make a path out of pebbles for some ants to follow!

## Build
To install and build, clone the repository and use `build.sh`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Athan13/cli-spline.git
$ bash build.sh
```

You can now run the game with `./cli-spline`.

Dependencies are ncurses and GSL, `build.sh` is written for gcc.
