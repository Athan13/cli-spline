# CLI-Spline

A small CLI game using cubic spline interpolation (pronounced *klie-spline*). Make a path out of pebbles for some ants to follow!

## Build
To install and build, clone the repository and use `build.sh`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Athan13/cli-spline.git
$ cd cli-spline
$ bash build.sh
```

You can now run the game with `./cli-spline`.

Dependencies are [ncurses](https://invisible-island.net/ncurses/announce.html) (usually present on a system by default) and [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). `build.sh` is written for gcc.
